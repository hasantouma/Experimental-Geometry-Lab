My work at the Experimental Geometry Lab in the Mathematics Department at the University of Maryland.

The code can be found in ```FD of a Circle Bundles over a Surface.nb```

A PDF of the code is also available if you don't have Mathematica installed on your computer.

The end of semester presentation can be found in the ```HasanIanLaTeX.pdf``` file, with the notes in ```Notes_for_EGL.pdf```
